# Mitigation Recommendations

## Immediate
- Upgrade to Log4j 2.17.1 or higher
- Set system property: -Dlog4j2.formatMsgNoLookups=true
- Delete JndiLookup.class from classpath

## Long-Term
- Use safer logging frameworks (e.g., SLF4J with Logback)
- Enforce least privilege on outbound connections from Java apps
- Introduce egress filtering and firewall rules to block LDAP/RMI traffic
- Run Java apps in containers with strict runtime controls
