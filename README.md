# Phylax Security Context Protocols (SCP)

Welcome to the official SCP registry maintained by **Phylax Security** — a living, open-source repository of deeply structured and AI-ready threat profiles for software vulnerabilities.

This project is based on the Model Context Protocol (MCP) concept and is designed for tools built by Anthropic, OpenAI, Microsoft Copilot, Cursor, Windsurf and other LLM agents to inject security-relevant context into software output during "vibe coding."

> _SCPs are the missing semantic link between CVE intelligence and LLM-aware software development._

## What Are SCPs?

**Security Context Protocols (SCPs)** are standardized, context-rich representations of real-world CVEs, focused on:

- Vulnerabilities inherent in source code
- Risks introduced via LLM-generated code
- Developer-relevant injection flaws, deserialization issues, RCEs
- Use in CI/CD pipelines, AI code assistants, IDE plugins, and red team tooling

Each SCP is packaged for:

- ✅ AI prompt alignment (Copilot, VSCode plugins, GPT agents)
- ✅ CI/CD scanning and validation
- ✅ Red teaming and exploit simulation
- ✅ Secure coding education and linting

🚀 Getting Started
Clone the Repository
```
git clone https://github.com/phylaxsecurity/scp-registry.git
cd scp-registry
```
Explore Available CVEs


```ls resources/```
Validate SCP Files
```
python validate_scp.py --schema scp-spec/schema.json --file resources/**/scp.json
```

🧠 MVP Integration (5.30.2025) Integrating with Claude Desktop
Download the repository to your local machine.

Open Claude Desktop.

Drag and Drop the entire scp-registry folder into Claude.

Prompt Claude with:

"Utilize the uploaded Security Context Protocols (SCPs) to assist in identifying and mitigating CVE-related vulnerabilities in my code."

Claude will automatically parse the manifest.json and structure, providing contextual assistance based on the SCP data.

🔧 Runtime Server (Optional)
For advanced integrations, deploy the FastAPI-based runtime server:
```
cd scp-runtime
docker compose up
```
Access the API documentation at: http://localhost:8000/docs
