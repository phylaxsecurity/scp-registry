# Advanced Detection Guidance

## Signature-Based
- Use YARA rules to identify payload patterns in logs
- IDS/IPS tools like Suricata or Snort:
  Rule example:
    alert tcp any any -> any any (msg:"Log4Shell Attempt"; content:"${jndi:"; nocase; sid:100001;)

## Behavioral
- Monitor Java processes for outbound LDAP, RMI, or DNS connections
- Flag JAR downloads or class loading from remote hosts
- Watch for suspicious deserialization behavior

## Log Analysis Tips
- Scan HTTP headers and user-agent fields
- Decompress and parse archived logs for obfuscated patterns
